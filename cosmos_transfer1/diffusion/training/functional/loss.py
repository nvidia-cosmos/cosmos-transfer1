    """
    Creates a per-sample loss mask based on the given configuration and input data batch.

    This function generates a dictionary of loss masks for each specified key in the loss masking configuration.
    For keys present in both the configuration and the data batch, the corresponding data batch value is used.
    For keys present only in the configuration, a tensor of zeros with the specified shape is created.
    Additionally, it computes loss mask weights for each key based on the configuration values and adjusts them
    based on the presence of certain keys in the data batch, such as "skip_face" and "object_loss_map".

    Note:
    - The original `loss_masking_cfg` and `data_batch` are not modified by this function.
    - For image data, it is assumed that the channel is always the first dimension.
    - `skip_face` is for face regions that should be skipped during training, the key is provided so that we can generate
    diverse human and avoid collapse to a single face given certain prompts. The issue happens for getty projects,
    where face distribution in the dataset is high unbalanced that single man face can be shown in more than 100+ images.

    Parameters:
        loss_masking_cfg (dict): Configuration for loss masking, specifying which keys to include and their weights.
        data_batch (dict): The batch of data containing actual data points and potential mask indicators like "skip_face".
        x_shape (tuple): The shape of the input data, used to initialize zero masks for keys not in the data batch.
        dtype (torch.dtype): The data type for the tensors in the loss masks.
        device (str, optional): The device on which to create the tensors. Defaults to 'cuda'.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing combined loss masks adjusted according to the `loss_masking_cfg` and `data_batch`.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If "skip_face" is not present in `data_batch`.

    Note: `create_combined_loss_mask` is assumed to be a separate function that combines individual loss masks into a
    single mask or set of masks based on the given parameters. Its behavior should be documented separately.

    """
    Creates a combined loss mask from multiple input masks.

    This function combines several loss masks into a single mask. In regions where masks overlap,
    the highest value is assigned. Non-overlapping regions are assigned a default value of 1.
    Regions with a mask value of zero are explicitly zeroed out, which is essential for padded loss calculations.

    Example:
        Given the following masks and weights:
            mask1: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], weight: 2
            mask2: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], weight: 4
            mask3: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], weight: 0
        The resulting combined loss mask would be:
            [4, 0, 4, 2, 1, 1]

    Parameters:
        data (dict): Contains the loss masks and their weights.
        x_shape (tuple): The shape of the output mask.
        dtype: The data type for the output mask.
        device: The device on which the output mask will be allocated.
        loss_masking: The loss masking weight configuration.
