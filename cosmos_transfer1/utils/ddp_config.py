    A decorator that adds the capability to freeze instances of an attrs-defined class.

    NOTE: This requires the wrapped attrs to be defined with attrs.define(slots=False) because we need
    to hack on a "_is_frozen" attribute.

    This decorator enhances an attrs-defined class with the ability to be "frozen" at runtime.
    Once an instance is frozen, its attributes cannot be changed. It also recursively freezes
    any attrs-defined objects that are attributes of the class.

    Usage:
        @make_freezable
        @attrs.define(slots=False)
        class MyClass:
            attribute1: int
            attribute2: str

        obj = MyClass(1, 'a')
        obj.freeze()  # Freeze the instance
        obj.attribute1 = 2  # Raises AttributeError

    Args:
        cls: The class to be decorated.

        The decorated class with added freezing capability.
