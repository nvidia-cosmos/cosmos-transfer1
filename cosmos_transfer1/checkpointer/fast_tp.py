        Load state_dict and broadcast efficiently.

        This method optimizes checkpoint loading for distributed training for improved
        connection speed and reliability.

        The main steps are:
        1. Retrieve TP-rank-specific checkpoints for each GPU of DDP-rank 0
           and CP-rank 0.
        2. Each rank loads its corresponding checkpoint either from a local cache or
           receives it via broadcast.

        This approach ensures that each MP (Model Parallelism) rank loads its specific
        part of the model, which is crucial for scenarios where different parts of the
        model are distributed across multiple GPUs.

        The method supports both Tensor Parallelism (TP) and standard Data Parallel (DP)
        training. For TP, each rank can efficiently load its specific checkpoint from S3.
        For standard DDP without TP, the default broadcast mechanism is used.

        Args:
            checkpoint_path (str): The base path of the checkpoint in S3.
            model (DiffusionModel): The model being loaded.
            resume_keys (Set): Set of keys to resume from the checkpoint.

        Returns:
            dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the loaded state for each resumed key.

        Note:
            This implementation has been tested and optimized for 4K GPU training jobs,
            showing significant improvements in connection speed and overall efficiency.
